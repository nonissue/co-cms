Collate CMS:

Conceptually:
  ✔ How do we identify users if we use an auth provider like github? @done(20-07-23 16:40)
    ✔ Hooked into next-auth to return oauth id from github request @done(20-07-23 16:40)
  ✔ Only access next auth provider on admin routes @done(20-07-30 23:44)
  ☐ Use project structure as a skeleton/starter for other projects, like nonissue.org
    - Projects all use prisma for data layer
    - Next.js for frontend
    - Simple cms with easy to scaffold CRUD frontends
    - Longterm: great image processing a la gatsby image

Tests:
  ☐ https://github.com/drkgrntt/papyr-cms/tree/master/src/test
  ☐ Prisma 
    ☐ Tag creation tests (eg. " " doesn't end up causing the creation of two tags with '' as the title, etc)
  ☐ Auth routes
  ☐ Test api methods:
    ☐ Create, Update, Etc.

API: 
  ✔ All in [id].js? @done(20-07-31 00:00)
    ✔ /api/lates/[id] -> returns specified late @done(20-07-30 16:21)
    ✔ /api/lates/[id] METHOD: PUT -> updates @done(20-07-31 00:00) UPDATE: API method works (tested in insomnia)
    ✔ /api/lates/[id] METHOD: DELETE -> deletes @done(20-07-30 23:44)
  ☐ Seed db on startup
  ☐ Users route
  ☐ When fetching tags on `/pages/tags/index.js`, fetch count as well
  ☐ Fetch (scrape?) Late page title from URL 
    ☐ When? On form submission?
  ✔ Slugify tags or make sure they are only a single word @done(20-07-22 17:24)
  ✔ Create tags from array of provided tags (space delimited) @done(20-07-22 17:24)
  ☐ "In addition to friendly URLs, resources that can be moved or be renamed SHOULD expose a URL that contains a unique stable identifier. 
    ☐ It MAY be necessary to interact with the service to obtain a stable URL from the friendly name for the resource, as in the case of the "/my" shortcut used by some services."
    ☐  Aka: if a tag is renamed, will that cause problems with routing?

Next.js:
  ✔ get fallback working? @done(20-07-14 19:30)
  ☐ Fetching in component vs pre-rendering: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#fetching-data-on-the-client-side
    ☐ "This approach works well for user dashboard pages, for example. Because a dashboard is a private, user-specific page, SEO is not relevant and the page doesn’t need to be pre-rendered. 
    ☐ The data is frequently updated, which requires request-time data fetching."


Typescript Migration:
  ☐ `api/lates/create.js` is ripe for migration

Bugs: 
  ☐ Prisma runtime: in `pages/lates/index.js`, unless we initialize prisma client in `getStaticProps`, an error is fired
    ☐ This happens even though the fetching for prisma happens in `api/feed.js`
    ☐ Doesn't seem to matter whether `api/feed.js` is ts or js
    ☐ Doesn't seem to matter where `const prisma = new PrismaClient();` is called in `api/feed.js`
  ☐ Can't fetch in prod, as it attempts to fetch from `localhost:3000/api` @critical
    ☐ So use `process.env.SITE` in fetch request

Frontend:
  ✔ Clean up styles @done(20-07-30 23:50)
  ☐ Validate urls on late create
  ☐ Change admin data fetching to plain client side fetches (don't need SEO)
  ☐ `/lates` is a prerendered page, but `/lates/1/` isn't? (same with tags) @critical
  ☐ Figure out how to make api calls when deployed to prod @critical (fetch has issues)
  ☐ change getStaticPaths so it fetches from `/api/` rather than calling prisma directly
  ☐ Dropdown confined to viewport/container
  ☐ Implement css transitions a la: https://codesandbox.io/s/css-modules-csstransition-0y34s
  ☐ Better form error handling
    ☐ For forms (handled with the implementation of formik)
    ☐ For api calls (where to surface error to user, how to log, etc)
  ☐ Implement combo box for tag input 
    ☐ https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/forms/combo-box -> results get put in selectedOptions [{label: 'value'}]
      ☐ https://codesandbox.io/s/8lv12?file=/index.js
    ☐ https://evergreen.segment.com/components/tag-input
  ☐ Style lates list, single late, tags list, single tag
  ✔ Link from lates list to individual late @done(20-07-20 22:31)
    ✔ Route by ID? Since url is the only known property, seems safest, slugs won't work since title optional @done(20-07-14 19:30)
  ✔ Fix header rendering flash (only on FF?) @done(20-07-14 19:30)
    ✔ Seems to happen on multiple pages (not just create) @done(20-07-11 22:29)
    ✔ next auth example doesn't have issue @done(20-07-11 22:29)
    ✔ neither does co-cms commit `5d78324bfb18ed0f5fdb2dfca6c362ce83482bdf` @done(20-07-11 22:29)
    ✔ DOESN'T HAPPEN WHEN DEPLOYED @critical @done(20-07-14 19:30)
  ✔ Fix header offset height (slightly too short, when rendering header height is increased) @done(20-07-14 19:30)
    ✔ Only FF? @done(20-07-14 19:30)
  ✔ Export static paths? @done(20-07-20 21:31)
  ✔ Format dates correctly @done(20-07-20 22:31)
  ✔ Move dropdown to independent component @done(20-07-20 22:31)
  ✔ lates/[id].js and tags/[title].js are hugely overcomplicated, simplify data fetching @started(20-07-30 15:01) @done(20-07-30 16:33) @lasted(1h32m45s)
  ✔ Move `/lates/create` to `/admin/lates/create` @done(20-07-30 16:35)
  ✔ Admin dashboard (with useServerSideProps && auth) @done(20-07-30 16:58)
    ✔ Remove auth context provider from main route @done(20-07-30 16:58)
  ✔ If dropdown action link is clicked, page scrolls back to top? @done(20-07-20 22:46) FIXED: was because the <a> was routing
  ✔ Tag input (space delimited, split into array before sending to api) @done(20-07-22 17:24)
  ✔ make menu rendering the same between public & admin @done(20-07-30 16:33)
  ✔ Admin: clicking on profile picture shows dropdown with account options @done(20-07-30 16:47)
  ✔ Link hover cursor: @done(20-07-30 16:49) UPDATE: Fixed by just modifying dropdown so {children} are styled with :hover cursor: pointer
    ✔ Avatar @done(20-07-30 16:49)
    ✔ Dropdowns @done(20-07-30 16:49)
  ✔ Fetch oauth user id with next auth when signing in @done(20-07-30 16:35)
