Conceptually:
  ☐ How do we identify users if we use an auth provider like github?
  

API: 
  

Frontend:
  ☐ Link from lates list to individual late
    ☐ Route by ID? Since url is the only known property, seems safest, slugs won't work since title optional
  ☐ Clean up styles
  ☐ Fix header rendering flash (only on FF?)
    ☐ Seems to happen on multiple pages (not just create)
    ☐ next auth example doesn't have issue
    ☐ neither does co-cms commit `5d78324bfb18ed0f5fdb2dfca6c362ce83482bdf`
