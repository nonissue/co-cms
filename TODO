Conceptually:
  ✔ How do we identify users if we use an auth provider like github? @done(20-07-23 16:40)
    ✔ Hooked into next-auth to return oauth id from github request @done(20-07-23 16:40)
  ☐ Only access next auth provider on admin routes
  
Tests:
  ☐ Prisma 
    ☐ Tag creation tests
  ☐ Auth routes

API: 
  ☐ Implement all crud operations
  ☐ All in [id].js?
    ☐ /api/lates/[id] -> returns specified late
    ☐ /api/lates/[id] METHOD: PUT -> updates
    ☐ /api/lates/[id] METHOD: DELETE -> deletes
  ☐ Seed db on startup
  ☐ Users route
  ✔ Slugify tags or make sure they are only a single word @done(20-07-22 17:24)
  ✔ Create tags from array of provided tags (space delimited) @done(20-07-22 17:24)
  ☐ Check for orphaned tags
  ☐ Fetch Late page title from URL 
    ☐ When? On form submission?

Next.js:
  ✔ get fallback working? @done(20-07-14 19:30)

Frontend:
  ✔ Link from lates list to individual late @done(20-07-20 22:31)
    ✔ Route by ID? Since url is the only known property, seems safest, slugs won't work since title optional @done(20-07-14 19:30)
  ☐ Clean up styles
  ✔ Fix header rendering flash (only on FF?) @done(20-07-14 19:30)
    ✔ Seems to happen on multiple pages (not just create) @done(20-07-11 22:29)
    ✔ next auth example doesn't have issue @done(20-07-11 22:29)
    ✔ neither does co-cms commit `5d78324bfb18ed0f5fdb2dfca6c362ce83482bdf` @done(20-07-11 22:29)
    ✔ DOESN'T HAPPEN WHEN DEPLOYED @critical @done(20-07-14 19:30)
  ✔ Fix header offset height (slightly too short, when rendering header height is increased) @done(20-07-14 19:30)
    ✔ Only FF? @done(20-07-14 19:30)
  ✔ Export static paths? @done(20-07-20 21:31)
  ☐ Custom fonts
  ✔ Format dates correctly @done(20-07-20 22:31)
  ✔ Move dropdown to independent component @done(20-07-20 22:31)
  ☐ Validate urls on late create
  ☐ lates/[id].js and tags/[title].js are hugely overcomplicated, simplify data fetching @started(20-07-30 15:01)
  ☐ Move `/lates/create` to `/admin/lates/create`
  ☐ Admin dashboard (with useServerSideProps && auth) 
    ☐ Remove auth context provider from main route
  ☐ Style lates list, single late, tags list, single tag
  ✔ If dropdown action link is clicked, page scrolls back to top? @done(20-07-20 22:46) FIXED: was because the <a> was routing
  ☐ `/lates` is a prerendered page, but `/lates/1/` isn't? (same with tags)
  ✔ Tag input (space delimited, split into array before sending to api) @done(20-07-22 17:24)
  ☐ make menu rendering the same between public & admin
  ☐ Admin: clicking on profile picture shows dropdown with account options 
  ☐ Header link hover -> pointer
  ☐ Better form error handling
  ☐ Implement combo box for tag input 
    ☐ https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/forms/combo-box -> results get put in selectedOptions [{label: 'value'}]
      ☐ https://codesandbox.io/s/8lv12?file=/index.js
    ☐ https://evergreen.segment.com/components/tag-input

  
Someday:
  ☐ Google text processing ML to generate tags
  ☐ Typescript
  ☐ Formik for forms
  ☐ ElasticUI for dashboard
