Conceptually:
  ☐ How do we identify users if we use an auth provider like github?
  

API: 
  ☐ Implement all crud operations
  ☐ All in [id].js?
    ☐ /api/late/[id] -> returns specified late
    ☐ /api/late/[id] METHOD: PUT -> updates
    /api/late/[id] METHOD: DELETE -> deletes
  ☐ Seed db on startup
  ☐ Users route
  ☐ Slugify tags or make sure they are only a single word

Next.js:
  ✔ get fallback working? @done(20-07-14 19:30)

Frontend:
  ☐ Link from lates list to individual late
    ✔ Route by ID? Since url is the only known property, seems safest, slugs won't work since title optional @done(20-07-14 19:30)
  ☐ Clean up styles
  ✔ Fix header rendering flash (only on FF?) @done(20-07-14 19:30)
    ✔ Seems to happen on multiple pages (not just create) @done(20-07-11 22:29)
    ✔ next auth example doesn't have issue @done(20-07-11 22:29)
    ✔ neither does co-cms commit `5d78324bfb18ed0f5fdb2dfca6c362ce83482bdf` @done(20-07-11 22:29)
    ✔ DOESN'T HAPPEN WHEN DEPLOYED @critical @done(20-07-14 19:30)
  ✔ Fix header offset height (slightly too short, when rendering header height is increased) @done(20-07-14 19:30)
    ✔ Only FF? @done(20-07-14 19:30)
  ✔ Export static paths? @done(20-07-20 21:31)
  ☐ Custom fonts
  ☐ Format dates correctly
  ✔ Move dropdown to independent component @done(20-07-20 22:31)
