# Collate

An interface for collecting interesting things, and a service that automatically augments the things you collect with metadata.

## Examples:

- You want to start keeping track of words you find interesting. Collate provides a simple interface for you to collect these words across services. And when you add a word to your collate word list, collate asynchronously fetches the definition and synonyms for said word and stores it conveniently alongside.
- You keep a list of movies you want to watch. Each time a new movie is added, collate fetches the IMDB rating, metacritic score, rottentomatoes score, cast list and synopsis of the movie.
